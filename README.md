# vgm2gbs

A custom Python-based converter for Pegmode's [Deflemask GB Engine][dgb-engine] that
supports conversion of VGM files generated by [Furnace][furnace]. Not a whole lot of
VGM commands are implemented, so I can't guarantee compatibility with other VGMs but
I'd imagine that many of them would work. Feel free to open an issue/PR if you'd like
to see more features added.

## Usage

You will need Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system. Then you can clone or
download the contents of the repository to someplace on your system.

If you're on Windows, you can simply drag a VGM file onto `convert.bat`, and it will
be converted to a GBS file with the same name.

Otherwise, from the command line:

```bash
python3 src/vgm.py input.vgm output.gbs
```
